# Comprehensive IIH Research Data (2021-2025)

## Important Patient Information About Weight and IIH

### The Weight Misconception
One of the significant issues that research doesn't adequately address is that IIH is often NOT simply weight-related. Given that IIH is a symptom rather than a single condition, it likely represents many different conditions with the same symptom. While some patients see relief or even remission with weight loss, many others don't experience improvement.

### Key Points for Patients:
- Many doctors prescribe weight loss and effectively blame patients for their condition
- Numerous patients experience unexplained weight gain as another symptom
- Weight loss can exacerbate other symptoms for some people
- Many patients have hormonal issues that fluctuate with hormone levels (e.g., menstrual cycles)
- Eventually, distinguishing the various underlying conditions will explain these differences
- Patients need to be informed as many doctors have outdated knowledge
- Some doctors still refer to it as BIH (Benign Intracranial Hypertension) despite the name changing over 2 decades ago

## Recent Research Papers (2021-2025)

### 2025 Papers

#### 1. A Randomized Sequential Cross-Over Trial Evaluating Five ICP-Lowering Drugs in IIH
**Authors:** James L. Mitchell et al.  
**Journal:** Headache: The Journal of Head & Face Pain (2025)  
**DOI:** 10.1111/head.14897  
**Summary:** This unique crossover trial tested five medications commonly used in IIH – acetazolamide, topiramate, furosemide, spironolactone, and amiloride – in 14 women with active IIH. Each drug was given for 2 weeks in random sequence, with telemetric intracranial pressure monitoring throughout. Four of the five drugs produced small mean ICP reductions after 2 weeks: acetazolamide, furosemide, and spironolactone lowered ICP by ~2.7–3.3 mmHg, and topiramate by ~2.3 mmHg (all statistically significant vs baseline). Amiloride was the only tested drug without a significant effect. Notably, there were no significant differences between the drugs' efficacy in lowering ICP, given the small sample. Side effects were frequent – 100% of patients on acetazolamide and 93% on topiramate reported adverse effects (like fatigue, paresthesias, or cognitive slowing). Cognitive testing showed a trend toward mild worsening of some cognitive functions on acetazolamide and topiramate. The authors conclude that these standard drugs produce only marginal ICP reductions and often cause intolerable side effects. Better-tolerated therapies with greater efficacy (for example, the emerging GLP-1 agonists) are greatly needed in IIH management.

#### 2. Imaging Hallmarks of IIH and Insights into Pathogenesis
**Authors:** Basimah A. Albalooshy, Scott S. Faro, Hsiangkuo Yuan, et al.  
**Journal:** Frontiers in Radiology (2025)  
**DOI:** 10.3389/fradi.2025.1605777  
**Summary:** This open-access review discusses the characteristic neuroimaging features of IIH and what they reveal about disease pathophysiology. It outlines classic MRI signs of raised intracranial pressure – including an empty sella, perioptic subarachnoid space enlargement, optic nerve head protrusion, globe flattening, and transverse sinus stenoses – and notes these can support an IIH diagnosis even when papilledema is absent. The authors also explore advanced imaging and the role of the glymphatic system in IIH. New evidence suggests that impaired glymphatic CSF drainage (the brain's lymphatic-like clearance pathway) may contribute to IIH pathogenesis. They review how novel MRI techniques – volumetric analyses, flow studies, and contrast imaging – indicate disrupted CSF flow dynamics in IIH, with signs of both excess production (e.g. choroid plexus hyperactivity) and impaired resorption of CSF. The review concludes that integrating neuroimaging with our growing understanding of CSF physiology (including glymphatic flow) is key to unraveling IIH's pathophysiology. Cutting-edge imaging modalities could improve IIH diagnosis and potentially monitor response to treatments by visualizing intracranial pressure changes and fluid drainage in vivo.

#### 3. Clinical Features and Diagnosis of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
**Authors:** Aileen A. Antonio  
**Journal:** Continuum: Lifelong Learning in Neurology (June 2025)  
**DOI:** 10.1212/CON.0000000000001570  
**Summary:** This is a comprehensive clinical review focusing on IIH presentation and diagnostic work-up. It emphasizes that IIH predominantly affects young obese women and can lead to significant disability (chronic headache, visual loss) if not recognized early. The article highlights recent epidemiologic trends – the incidence of IIH is rising worldwide in parallel with obesity rates, increasing the burden on health systems. It also discusses health disparities: emerging data suggest racial/ethnic differences in IIH occurrence and outcomes, possibly linked to inequities in access to care and social determinants of health. A major point is the risk of overdiagnosis: because headache is common, some patients are misdiagnosed with IIH without meeting proper criteria, leading to unnecessary treatments. Dr. Antonio reviews the diagnostic criteria (including the modified Dandy criteria) and stresses careful neuro-ophthalmologic exam (looking for papilledema) and lumbar puncture measurement of opening pressure. The article's key message is to apply diagnostic criteria stringently and refer early to specialists (neurology and neuro-ophthalmology) to confirm the diagnosis. Timely diagnosis and management are crucial to prevent permanent vision loss in true IIH, while avoiding improper labeling of patients who have other headache etiologies.

#### 4. Treatment and Monitoring of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
**Authors:** John J. Chen, Susan P. Mollan  
**Journal:** Continuum: Lifelong Learning in Neurology (June 2025)  
**DOI:** 10.1212/CONT.0000000000001586  
**Summary:** This up-to-date clinical review covers IIH therapy and follow-up. It notes that IIH incidence and prevalence continue to rise due to the global obesity epidemic, and that IIH is now understood to have a unique systemic metabolic profile (distinct from simple obesity) that may open the door to new treatments. The authors reaffirm that the first-line treatment is weight loss (dietary or surgical) which can lead to disease remission. Acetazolamide remains the most commonly used medication for IIH, despite no FDA-approved drugs for this condition. Topiramate is also used for its dual benefit on headaches and weight. The article discusses monitoring strategies: regular ophthalmologic exams (visual fields, optical coherence tomography of the optic nerve) are essential, as vision protection is the top priority. If vision is threatened or medical therapy fails, surgical interventions are considered – CSF shunting or venous sinus stenting. Notably, venous sinus stenting has gained popularity in recent years as an alternative to shunts, with expanding experience worldwide. The review also highlights emerging medical therapies, particularly GLP-1 agonists like exenatide. A recent trial showed exenatide can reduce intracranial pressure even without weight loss, suggesting a promising new avenue for treatment. Overall, optimal care requires a multidisciplinary approach (neurology, ophthalmology, neurosurgery), individualized to disease severity, with close monitoring of visual function and headaches to guide therapy adjustments.

#### 5. Current Understanding of the Pathophysiology of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
**Authors:** Michael J. Lowe, Gabriele Berman, Priya Sumithran, Susan P. Mollan  
**Journal:** Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports (2025)  
**DOI:** 10.1007/s11910-025-01420-y  
**Summary:** This is a state-of-the-art review of recent research into IIH mechanisms. It reinforces that IIH is not simply due to obesity but involves complex metabolic and hormonal dysregulation. Patients with active IIH have been found to exhibit insulin resistance, elevated leptin levels, androgen excess, and an inflammatory profile – changes that resolve after the disease goes into remission. Such findings suggest these systemic abnormalities contribute causally to raised intracranial pressure. In particular, evidence indicates that CSF overproduction at the choroid plexus (possibly driven by androgen and glucocorticoid abnormalities) is a key factor, along with impaired CSF absorption in the venous sinuses. The authors propose that IIH's core pathogenesis is a vicious cycle: systemic metabolic changes (tied to obesity) lead to increased CSF secretion and perhaps reduced drainage, causing intracranial hypertension, which then further disrupts downstream venous and glymphatic pathways. This aligns with weight loss being the only curative treatment – it favorably alters the metabolic milieu. The review concludes that IIH has a distinctive neuro-endocrine-metabolic signature separate from obesity alone. Recognizing IIH as a multi-system disorder has already spurred novel treatments (like GLP-1 agonists) and will be crucial for developing targeted, safe therapies to supplement the current reliance on diuretics and surgery.

### 2024 Papers

#### 1. The Additive Value of Complementing Diagnostic IIH Criteria with MRI: An External Validation Study
**Authors:** Stefan Macher et al.  
**Journal:** Journal of Headache and Pain (2024)  
**DOI:** 10.1186/s10194-024-01781-8  
**Summary:** This study externally validated newly proposed diagnostic criteria for IIH that incorporate standardized MRI findings alongside clinical features. The criteria define IIH by the presence of any two of: papilledema, elevated lumbar puncture opening pressure (≥25 cm H₂O), or ≥3 of 4 characteristic MRI signs (such as perioptic subarachnoid space distension, transverse sinus stenosis, posterior globe flattening, empty sella). In a cohort of 125 patients evaluated for IIH in Vienna, the MRI criterion alone (≥3 of 4 signs) showed moderate sensitivity (39%) but excellent specificity (91%) for true IIH. Combining criteria (the "2 out of 3" rule) improved overall diagnostic accuracy – it identified all definite IIH cases and correctly excluded all non-IIH cases in this sample. The authors conclude that adding MRI-based signs is clinically useful: the standardized neuroimaging criteria were easy to apply and highly specific, and using "2 of 3" objective criteria simplifies IIH diagnosis without sacrificing accuracy. This supports the incorporation of MRI features into future diagnostic guidelines for IIH.

#### 2. Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Pathogenesis: The Jugular Hypothesis
**Authors:** Kyle M. Fargen et al.  
**Journal:** Interventional Neuroradiology (2024)  
**DOI:** 10.1177/15910199241270660  
**Summary:** This paper proposes a unifying hypothesis that implicates intrinsic internal jugular vein (IJV) abnormalities as a central driver of IIH. The authors note that IJVs in some individuals are anatomically prone to compression at multiple points (e.g. at the C1 transverse process, by neck muscles or lymph nodes) and that many IIH patients exhibit functional IJV narrowing with position changes. The "jugular hypothesis" posits that chronic, severe IJV outflow impairment leads to intracranial venous hypertension and impaired CSF absorption. In this model, poor jugular drainage (possibly exacerbated by inflammation or thrombosis) elevates venous sinus pressure, which in turn raises CSF pressure and triggers the familiar IIH cascade. The authors suggest that venous congestion overwhelms compensatory pathways (eg. the glymphatic system) and eventually causes secondary venous sinus stenosis ("downstream" transverse sinus collapse) that further amplifies intracranial pressure. While experimental, this paradigm highlights cervical venous outflow as a potential therapeutic target and encourages further study of IJV physiology in IIH.

### 2023 Papers

#### 1. Expanding the Clinical Spectrum of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
**Authors:** Benson S. Chen, John O. T. Britton  
**Journal:** Current Opinion in Neurology (2023)  
**DOI:** 10.1097/WCO.0000000000001131  
**Summary:** This review describes atypical presentations and manifestations of IIH that have broadened the recognized clinical spectrum. While most IIH patients present with bilateral papilledema and headaches, some present with unilateral or highly asymmetric papilledema, isolated cranial nerve palsies, or even IIH without papilledema (noted as "IIH without papilledema," or IIHWOP). These unusual cases suggest individual differences in how raised CSF pressure is compartmentalized or transmitted in the skull. Advances in neuroimaging have identified chronic effects of intracranial pressure, such as remodeling of the skull base with meningoencephaloceles. Notably, chronic intracranial hypertension can lead to bone erosion and spontaneous CSF leaks (e.g. CSF rhinorrhea), and such osseous changes have been observed in IIH patients and linked syndromes. The authors emphasize that clinicians should recognize these diverse presentations of IIH, as they have implications for diagnosis and management (for example, recognizing IIH in a patient with isolated sixth-nerve palsy or treating IIHWOP as a chronic headache disorder related to intracranial pressure).

#### 2. Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: A Step Change in Understanding the Disease Mechanisms
**Authors:** Andreas Yiangou, Susan P. Mollan, Alexandra J. Sinclair  
**Journal:** Nature Reviews Neurology (2023)  
**DOI:** 10.1038/s41582-023-00893-0  
**Summary:** This authoritative review reframes IIH as primarily a systemic metabolic disorder rather than a purely idiopathic neurological condition. Over 95% of IIH patients are obese women of childbearing age, and the global rise in IIH incidence mirrors increasing obesity rates. Emerging data reveal distinctive metabolic and endocrine perturbations in IIH: insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, dyslipidemia, and androgen excess occur at higher rates than in BMI-matched obese controls. These changes likely drive increased CSF production (via choroid plexus androgen and glucocorticoid receptors) and perhaps reduced CSF drainage, culminating in raised intracranial pressure. IIH is also associated with a doubled risk of cardiovascular disease beyond that expected from obesity alone. The review notes that weight loss is the only proven disease-modifying therapy – significant weight reduction (often via bariatric surgery) can normalize intracranial pressure and induce remission. Finally, novel therapies targeting metabolic pathways are on the horizon: for example, a GLP-1 receptor agonist (exenatide) was shown in a Phase II trial to significantly lower intracranial pressure independent of weight loss.

### 2022 Paper

#### 1. Dural Venous Sinus Stenting in the Treatment of IIH: A Systematic Review and Critique
**Authors:** Anna Kabanovski, Eli Kisilevsky, Yelin Yang, Edward Margolin  
**Journal:** Survey of Ophthalmology (2022)  
**DOI:** 10.1016/j.survophthal.2021.05.002  
**Summary:** This paper reviewed the literature on transverse venous sinus stenting (VSS) as an intervention for IIH. It found that VSS can often relieve IIH symptoms (headache, papilledema, tinnitus) and lower intracranial pressure by resolving venous outflow obstruction. However, the authors caution that the available studies are mostly small series without controls, subject to selection bias. While many patients improve after stenting, a notable fraction (roughly 20–30%) experience persistent or recurrent symptoms post-procedure (as later meta-analyses also showed). The review highlights the low morbidity of stenting (serious complication rate ~1–2%) and the rising popularity of VSS as an alternative to CSF shunts. It calls for controlled trials, noting that it remains unclear which patients are optimal candidates and how VSS outcomes compare to traditional shunting in the long term, since over half of IIH patients in larger cohorts had symptom recurrence within a year of stenting.

### 2021 Papers

#### 1. Long-term Outcomes of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: Observational Study and Literature Review
**Authors:** William Xu, Zak Prime, Taras Papchenko, Helen V. Danesh-Meyer  
**Journal:** Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery (2021)  
**DOI:** 10.1016/j.clineuro.2020.106463  
**Summary:** A retrospective 12-year cohort study (132 IIH patients, ~91% female) found that most patients have good long-term outcomes. Visual function improved over time on average (papilledema resolved, median visual field mean deviation improved from –1.99 to –0.85 dB). Only ~6% required surgical interventions (shunts or fenestration) for severe disease. However, acetazolamide was poorly tolerated – 34% discontinued due to side effects. The authors conclude that while long-term visual and symptomatic prognosis in IIH is excellent for most, a subset with more severe disease needs surgery, and high medication side-effect rates highlight the need for better-tolerated therapies.

#### 2. Incidence, Prevalence, and Health Care Outcomes in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: A Population Study
**Authors:** Latif Miah et al.  
**Journal:** Neurology (2021)  
**DOI:** 10.1212/WNL.0000000000011463  
**Summary:** This Welsh population study (2003–2017) documented a dramatic rise in IIH incidence and prevalence in parallel with the obesity epidemic. Annual incidence increased from 2.3 to 7.8 per 100,000, and prevalence climbed from 12 to 76 per 100,000 over 15 years. IIH was strongly associated with higher body mass index and socioeconomic deprivation (patients from the most deprived areas had significantly higher risk). IIH patients had substantially greater health-care utilization: unscheduled hospital admission rates were ~5-fold higher than matched controls, and patients with CSF shunts had twice the admission rate of those managed non-surgically. These findings underscore the growing public health burden of IIH and the need for targeted interventions in high-risk populations.

#### 3. Effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery vs Community Weight Management for Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH:WT Trial)
**Authors:** Susan P. Mollan et al.  
**Journal:** JAMA Neurology (2021)  
**DOI:** 10.1001/jamaneurol.2021.0659  
**Summary:** This was a landmark 5-year randomized trial comparing bariatric surgery to a diet-based weight loss program in women with active IIH and obesity. At 12 months, the bariatric surgery group had a significantly greater reduction in intracranial pressure (opening pressure lowered by ~6 cm CSF more than the diet group), and this difference widened to 8.2 cm CSF by 24 months. Surgical patients lost ~26.6 kg more weight at 2 years than those in the community diet arm, and reported improved quality of life. The surgery arm saw higher rates of disease remission; overall, 84% of surgical patients achieved disease resolution vs. only 41% of those on diet in this study (as noted by the authors). The trial established that bariatric surgery is significantly more effective than medical weight management in lowering intracranial pressure and sustaining IIH remission, highlighting obesity surgery as a viable disease-modifying treatment for IIH.

## Recent Advances in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) (2024–2025)

### Pathophysiology and Mechanistic Insights

Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension involves a complex interplay of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, venous drainage, and systemic metabolic factors. New evidence suggests that increased CSF production may contribute to IIH – in animal models, high androgen levels (e.g. excess testosterone) upregulate choroid plexus transporters (NKCC1) and aquaporin-1, thereby augmenting CSF secretion. This offers a mechanistic link between the hormonal/metabolic milieu and raised intracranial pressure. 

Additionally, chronic dysregulation of glucocorticoids and adipokines has been implicated. IIH patients exhibit a distinctive metabolic-endocrine profile (for instance, a unique androgen excess signature and elevated 11β-HSD1 activity in adipose tissue) not entirely explained by obesity. Weight loss reduces 11β-HSD1 levels in IIH and correlates with ICP reduction, highlighting how systemic metabolic disturbances can drive intracranial hypertension. 

Correspondingly, recent mechanistic studies have identified novel therapeutic targets related to these pathways, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors (GLP-1R) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), which link gut hormone signaling and cortisol metabolism to CSF homeostasis. 

A longstanding question in IIH pathogenesis is the role of intracranial venous sinus stenosis. Most IIH patients have transverse sinus narrowing, which can elevate venous pressure and impair CSF absorption. It remains debated whether venous stenosis is a cause or consequence of raised ICP – rapid CSF removal via lumbar puncture can temporarily resolve stenoses, suggesting a pressure-driven collapse. A plausible model is a self-perpetuating feedback loop: mild initial ICP elevation (triggered by weight gain or hormonal changes) leads to venous compression, which further raises ICP in a vicious cycle. 

Recent studies distinguish "intrinsic" stenosis (fixed intraluminal obstructions such as venous webs or hypertrophic arachnoid granulations) from "extrinsic" stenosis (functional narrowing due to external pressure). This distinction is clinically relevant – as noted below, it may predict how well a patient responds to venous sinus stenting. 

There is also growing interest in the brain's fluid clearance systems: impaired glymphatic and lymphatic drainage has been proposed as a contributing factor. IIH patients were found to have enlarged extra-ventricular CSF spaces (≈30% larger than normal), possibly reflecting congestion of glymphatic flow. Impairment of interstitial fluid transport to meningeal lymphatics could thus trigger a "hydrodynamic cascade" leading to IIH. 

In summary, current research paints IIH as a multifactorial neurovascular disorder with important metabolic, endocrine, and anatomical contributors, rather than a purely "idiopathic" condition.

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Incidence of IIH is rising worldwide in parallel with the obesity epidemic. Extensive population data confirm this trend: for example, a large U.S. network study of >51,000 IIH patients found the annual incidence in adults increased from ~16 per 100,000 in 1990 to ~127 per 100,000 in 2024 (adjusted RR ~6.9). Similarly, UK and Scandinavian cohorts have documented several-fold increases in incidence over the past two decades. The disease predominantly affects women of childbearing age – in the U.S. study the female-to-male ratio rose to about 3.3:1, while in some regions it is even higher (up to 8:1) among young obese women. The highest IIH prevalence is often observed in populations with the greatest obesity rates. 

Notably, IIH incidence and severity also appear linked to socioeconomic factors; for example, areas with higher poverty and limited healthy food access see more cases, reflecting the intersection of obesity risk and health disparities. 

Obesity and recent weight gain are the strongest risk factors for IIH. Even moderate weight gain can precipitate IIH in individuals who are not yet morbidly obese. Conversely, weight loss of 5–10% can induce disease remission in many patients. Beyond body weight, new research underscores IIH as a systemic condition with broad metabolic implications. Patients with IIH have higher rates of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular comorbidities than weight-matched controls. In the U.S. cohort, IIH was independently associated with a 2.1-fold greater hazard of metabolic syndrome and ~1.8-fold higher risk of cardiovascular complications (e.g. hypertension, heart disease), even after adjusting for BMI. This reinforces the view of IIH as a neuro-metabolic disorder, not merely an isolated neurological issue. 

Hormonal and reproductive factors also intersect with IIH risk: women with IIH have higher frequencies of polycystic ovary syndrome and pregnancy-related complications. Notably, one study found a five-fold increased risk of pre-eclampsia and three-fold risk of gestational diabetes in women with IIH, suggesting overlapping pathways between IIH and dysregulated metabolic–endocrine states. 

There may also be a genetic predisposition in some cases – about 5% of IIH patients report a family history. Ongoing genome-wide association studies are exploring candidate genes, but as of 2025 no definitive susceptibility loci have been confirmed. Overall, the latest epidemiologic findings stress the importance of weight management and metabolic health in IIH prevention and outcomes.

### Diagnostic Innovations and Biomarkers

Diagnosing IIH still hinges on the Revised Friedman criteria (2013), which require evidence of papilledema and elevated lumbar puncture opening pressure (LP > 250 mm H₂O) after excluding secondary causes. However, recent studies highlight limitations of a strict LP pressure cutoff. A 2024 retrospective analysis examined patients with IIH-like symptoms but "borderline" CSF pressures. Among those with opening pressure in the 200–250 mm H₂O range, 40% had three or more characteristic neuroimaging signs of IIH (e.g. transverse sinus stenosis, empty sella, optic nerve sheath distension), compared to only 17% of those with LP < 200 mm H₂O. Additionally, 80% of the 200–250 mm H₂O group had venous sinus stenosis evident on MR venography, versus 40% of the sub-200 group. 

These findings suggest that some patients with "normal" or mildly elevated opening pressures do, in fact, have IIH – a scenario often termed "IIH without papilledema" (IIHWOP) or mild IIH. Such cases may benefit from treatment even if they fall short of classical criteria. As a result, clinicians are increasingly relying on ancillary diagnostic markers: MRI and MRV signs (empty sella, globe flattening, distal transverse sinus narrowing, etc.), clinical features like sixth-nerve palsy, and optical coherence tomography findings, to support an IIH diagnosis when the LP pressure is equivocal. The push for refined diagnostic criteria is growing, aiming to capture atypical cases while avoiding overdiagnosis of primary headache disorders as IIH.

Another area of progress is the development of non-invasive or minimally invasive ICP monitoring tools. An example is the MRI-based intracranial compliance measurement (sometimes termed MRI-ICP index). In a prospective pilot study, researchers used phase-contrast MRI to quantify intracranial volume–pressure relationships in IIH patients. They found that intracranial compliance index was significantly reduced in IIH (mean ~1006 cc/mmHg) compared to BMI-matched healthy controls (~1493 cc/mmHg). The lower the compliance (stiffer intracranial compartment), the higher the opening pressure – indeed compliance index inversely correlated with LP pressure (r ≈ –0.50, p = 0.029) and with headache severity scores. 

Equally important, after patients underwent treatment and weight loss interventions, their compliance index increased (i.e. brain compliance improved) at 12-month follow-up, paralleling a drop in ICP. This indicates MRI-derived compliance could serve as a surrogate biomarker for intracranial pressure and disease activity in IIH. It's an initial study, but a promising step toward non-invasive monitoring. Other approaches under investigation include transcranial Doppler-based formulas, optic nerve sheath ultrasound, and tympanic membrane displacement, though these have shown variable accuracy and are not yet replacements for direct measurement. 

In routine practice, ophthalmic imaging has become invaluable. High-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) is now commonly used to quantify papilledema by measuring peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness. OCT can objectively track the swelling of the optic disc and its resolution with treatment. This is particularly useful in monitoring IIH over time, as it provides a noninvasive, reproducible measure of treatment response in the eyes (often correlating with ICP trends). In fact, clinical trials and registries increasingly include OCT outcomes alongside visual field tests to assess IIH severity and remission. 

Researchers are also searching for fluid or molecular biomarkers of IIH. An exploratory 2024 study measured plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) – a neuropeptide involved in migraine – in IIH patients. The rationale is that IIH headaches might share pathways with migraine; if CGRP levels are elevated, anti-CGRP migraine therapies could potentially help IIH-related headaches. Early results are inconclusive but represent a broader biomarker effort, including studies of inflammatory cytokines, adipokines (like leptin), and neurofilament proteins in IIH. 

To summarize, recent advances in diagnostics are two-fold: (1) pushing the boundaries of what defines IIH (recognizing that some genuine cases have only modest pressure elevation but classic symptoms and imaging), and (2) developing better tools to measure ICP and papilledema objectively over time, reducing our reliance on serial lumbar punctures.

### Emerging Treatments and Clinical Trials

Management of IIH is evolving, with a number of groundbreaking therapeutic approaches emerging in the past 1–2 years. These span novel drug therapies, surgical innovations, and metabolic interventions, many of which have shown promising results in clinical studies:

#### Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1 RAs)
Perhaps the most significant recent breakthrough is the repurposing of GLP-1 analogs (typically used in diabetes/obesity) for IIH. In 2023, the phase 2 IIH:Pressure trial demonstrated that subcutaneous exenatide produces a meaningful reduction in intracranial pressure. Patients on exenatide had an average ICP decrease of ~5.7 cm CSF at 2.5 hours and ~5.6 cm CSF at 12 weeks, significantly greater than placebo. Clinically, this translated into markedly improved headaches – the treatment group experienced ~7.7 fewer headache days per month compared to baseline (nearly an 8-day reduction), whereas the placebo group improved by only ~1.5 days. All patients on exenatide were able to complete the 12-week course with few adverse effects, and importantly there were no cases of visual deterioration in the treated arm. 

This trial is a milestone: it provides the first high-level evidence of an ICP-lowering drug other than acetazolamide. The mechanism is thought to involve GLP-1 receptors in the choroid plexus – animal studies showed GLP-1 activation can reduce CSF secretion at the choroid plexus epithelium. Following on these results, larger trials are underway. A once-weekly injectable formulation of exenatide (named Presendin) is being tested in phase 3 trials: IIH EVOLVE (a global adult trial) and IIH Advance (a trial in adolescent IIH). 

Parallel to exenatide, other GLP-1 RAs are being explored. An open-label pilot study in 2023 investigated semaglutide (a weekly GLP-1 RA) as an adjunct therapy in IIH. Over 6 months, patients on semaglutide achieved significant weight loss (~12% body weight) and had fewer headache days, allowing reduction of acetazolamide dosages. Though small, this study reinforces that GLP-1 agonists address the root problem (obesity) and improve symptoms – a dual benefit. 

Notably, GLP-1 RAs also appear neurologically safe in IIH: cognitive testing found no impairment from exenatide, in contrast to the cognitive side effects seen with some traditional drugs. In fact, patients on exenatide showed improvements in certain cognitive domains (memory, processing speed) as their ICP normalized. Taken together, GLP-1 agonists are emerging as a highly promising class for IIH management, addressing both weight and ICP; they may become the first disease-modifying medical therapy for IIH if phase 3 trials are successful.

#### 11β-HSD1 Inhibition (Cortisol Modulation)
Another novel medical approach targets the cortisol metabolism pathway. IIH patients have been found to have higher intracellular cortisol activity (via the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1), which could contribute to sodium/water retention and CSF production. A phase 2 trial of AZD4017, an 11β-HSD1 inhibitor, was conducted to test this theory. The trial (published in late 2020, with renewed interest in 2022–2023) showed that AZD4017 was safe and well-tolerated in IIH patients. Although the primary endpoint – difference in ICP vs. placebo at 12 weeks – did not reach statistical significance, there were encouraging signs: only the AZD4017-treated group showed a within-patient ICP reduction over the 12 weeks, and the magnitude of ICP drop correlated with the degree of 11β-HSD1 inhibition (as measured by serum cortisol/cortisone ratios). 

In other words, patients who responded biochemically tended to have an ICP decrease. The average opening pressure fell by a few cmH₂O in the drug group while remaining flat in placebo, but the study was small (31 patients) and not powered to show a between-group difference. Investigators concluded that 11β-HSD1 inhibition "may have utility" in lowering ICP and warrants further research. This trial is significant because it validates the concept that IIH can be targeted through metabolic pathways (in this case, reducing cortisol regeneration in adipose tissue). While AZD4017 would likely need a larger trial or a more potent follow-up compound to prove efficacy, it opens the door to endocrine therapies for IIH.

#### Re-evaluation of Existing Medications
The mainstay medical treatments for IIH have long been carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide being first-line) and, secondarily, other diuretics or off-label drugs like topiramate. Until recently, there was scant direct evidence of how effective these drugs are at lowering ICP in humans. In 2025, a unique randomized cross-over trial reported on the short-term efficacy of five common IIH medications using telemetric intracranial pressure monitors. Fourteen women with active IIH received, in random sequence, 2 weeks of acetazolamide, furosemide, spironolactone, topiramate, and amiloride, with washout periods in between. 

Continuous ICP monitoring revealed that acetazolamide, furosemide, spironolactone, and topiramate each produced only a modest ICP reduction – on the order of 2–3 mmHg (approximately 2.7–3.3 mmHg for acetazolamide and ~2–3 mmHg for the others). Amiloride, interestingly, had essentially no effect on ICP in this study. There were no significant differences between the four effective drugs' magnitudes of ICP reduction, suggesting they all have a similar mild benefit. While these drops in pressure were statistically significant from baseline, they are relatively small – reinforcing that current drugs manage IIH incompletely. 

Moreover, the trial documented high rates of side effects: 100% of patients on acetazolamide and 93% on topiramate reported adverse effects (notably fatigue, cognitive slowing, paresthesias). Formal cognitive testing showed a trend toward worsened cognitive performance after 2 weeks on acetazolamide or topiramate (even as ICP fell). The authors concluded that while these medications do lower ICP slightly, their therapeutic index is narrow, and they often impair quality of life with side effects. This important study highlights the need for better-tolerated treatments (like those mentioned above). It also provides an evidence-based rationale to pursue new drug targets, since the existing ones (carbonic anhydrase inhibition, mild diuresis) yield only partial improvement. In practical terms, acetazolamide remains the first-line drug, but there is now quantification of its effect: about a 3 mmHg drop in ICP on average. For patients who cannot tolerate acetazolamide or topiramate, the study suggests furosemide or spironolactone could be reasonable second-line options with comparable efficacy.

#### Venous Sinus Stenting (VSS)
On the surgical front, transverse sinus stenting has moved from an experimental therapy to a more mainstream option for refractory IIH, especially in patients with significant venous sinus stenosis. Recent research has focused on long-term outcomes and factors predicting success of VSS. A prospective cohort study from China (Beijing) in early 2025 compared outcomes in IIH patients with intrinsic vs. extrinsic venous sinus stenosis who underwent stenting. The results were illuminating: at 6 months post-stent, patients with intrinsic stenosis (e.g. fixed focal narrowing due to intraluminal webs or thickened trabeculae) had a much higher rate of symptom resolution (81.7%) than those with extrinsic stenosis caused by elevated pressure (40.6% resolution). The intrinsic group also achieved lower follow-up CSF pressures (median 180 mmH₂O vs 210 mmH₂O in extrinsic) despite similar pre-stent pressures. 

In fact, statistical modeling suggested that about one-third of the better symptom outcome in intrinsic stenosis was mediated by greater ICP reduction after stenting. This suggests that stenosis etiology matters – those with a true anatomical blockage benefit most from stent placement, whereas those whose narrowing was secondary to high ICP may not normalize pressures as much (since the high ICP can recur if the underlying issue – e.g. obesity – remains). These findings underscore the importance of careful patient selection and high-resolution imaging (including IVUS, intravascular ultrasound, if available) to characterize stenosis type. 

Beyond 6-month outcomes, what about the durability of VSS? A multi-center retrospective study (Vanderbilt University, 2024) compared venous stenting vs. ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS) in IIH, with an emphasis on long-term headache control. Both groups had very high immediate success in relieving headache and papilledema (≥90% initial improvement for both VSS and shunt). However, over an average >1 year follow-up, headache recurrences were significantly lower after stenting. About 60% of shunt patients had a return of chronic headaches, compared to 31% of stented patients. This corresponded to VSS being associated with a 76% reduction in odds of headache recurrence relative to shunting (OR ~0.24). The need for re-intervention was also lower in the stent group. 

These data suggest that while both procedures are effective initially, stenting may offer more sustained relief, likely because shunts have higher failure and complication rates over time (blockages, infections, etc.). It's worth noting that with longer follow-up, some stented patients do develop recurrent symptoms as well – sometimes due to "re-equilibration" phenomenon, where a new stenosis forms just outside the stent or ICP rises again due to weight gain. Even so, the mid-term outcomes favor stents for many patients. Taken together, 2024–2025 research supports venous sinus stenting as a safe and effective intervention in properly selected IIH patients (particularly those with identifiable intrinsic stenosis and debilitating symptoms). Ongoing studies (including randomized trials) are being planned to directly compare stent vs. shunt in IIH, though ethical and recruitment challenges exist. For now, the trend in expert centers is toward offering VSS earlier in refractory cases or in those with dominant pulsatile tinnitus/papilledema and venographic evidence of a treatable sinus lesion.

#### Weight Loss and Metabolic Surgery
Given the central role of obesity in IIH, aggressive weight management remains the cornerstone of treatment. Recent research has put a spotlight on bariatric surgery as a therapeutic option for patients with severe obesity and IIH. In 2025, Cleveland Clinic investigators published a large retrospective study of 97 obese IIH patients who underwent bariatric surgery (mostly gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy) with a median follow-up of 3 years. The outcomes were very encouraging: headaches improved or resolved in the majority of patients, with a significant reduction in headache frequency and severity post-surgery (p < 0.001). Objective ophthalmologic measures also improved – papilledema resolved in many cases and visual field deficits significantly improved (p < 0.001). 

Perhaps most striking was the reduced reliance on other IIH treatments after weight loss surgery. The average number of IIH medications (acetazolamide, etc.) per patient dropped substantially (p < 0.001), and dosages of acetazolamide and topiramate could be lowered post-op. Before surgery, 27 patients in the cohort had required invasive procedures for IIH (shunts or optic nerve sheath fenestration); after surgery, only 17 patients went on to need such procedures – a non-significant decrease, but trending in the right direction. In other words, some patients who were headed towards shunts avoided them by losing weight. Even excluding those who eventually did need a shunt, the weight-loss-only group still had marked improvements in IIH outcomes. 

This study's "take-home" message was that bariatric surgery is a safe, effective, and durable treatment for IIH in the context of morbid obesity, often leading to long-term remission of the condition. The authors and experts now suggest that in patients with class III obesity or difficult-to-control IIH, metabolic surgery should be considered sooner rather than later. Sustained weight loss (whether via surgery or intensive lifestyle intervention) remains the only intervention proven to halt the underlying disease process. As new drugs like GLP-1 analogues facilitate weight loss medically, the hope is that more patients can achieve the >15–20% weight reduction that appears to dramatically improve IIH. Additionally, weight loss has systemic benefits (improving metabolic syndrome parameters) which, as noted, likely reduces the long-term cardiovascular risks that IIH patients face. In summary, the past year's findings strongly reinforce weight management as a pillar of IIH therapy, with bariatric surgery emerging as a highly beneficial option for eligible patients.

In summary, the landscape of IIH research in the last 6–12 months is one of cautious optimism. Groundbreaking trials (exenatide for ICP lowering, semaglutide for weight loss) and novel insights into pathophysiology (roles of androgens, glucocorticoids, and glymphatics) are paving the way for targeted therapies that go beyond symptomatic relief. Ongoing clinical trials and recently launched studies will further test these innovations: in addition to the phase 3 GLP-1 RA trials, investigators are exploring other headache-targeted therapies (such as CGRP monoclonal antibodies for IIH-associated headache) and potential neuroprotective agents to preserve vision. Meanwhile, advancements in imaging and monitoring (MRI compliance indices, OCT of the optic nerve) are improving our ability to diagnose and follow IIH patients with greater precision and less invasiveness. Although IIH remains challenging, especially in the context of the global obesity epidemic, these recent developments offer hope that we are moving toward more effective and even curative strategies. Researchers and clinicians worldwide are increasingly viewing IIH as a multidisciplinary problem – requiring neurologic, ophthalmologic, metabolic, and sometimes surgical expertise – and the global efforts of the past year reflect exactly that comprehensive approach.

## Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) – Incidence and Prevalence Trends

### Rising Incidence and Prevalence of IIH (2015–2025)

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is an uncommon condition of raised intracranial pressure with normal brain imaging, traditionally considered "benign" but now recognized as a rising public health concern. In the last decade, incidence and prevalence of IIH have increased significantly in many populations, closely mirroring the obesity epidemic. Globally, older estimates placed IIH prevalence around 0.5–2 per 100,000, but recent data show substantially higher figures in developed countries. This disease overwhelmingly affects women of childbearing age (typically 80–90% of cases) and is strongly associated with obesity. Men represent a small minority of cases, and when IIH occurs in men it tends to present at a slightly older age (30s). Below is a region-wise breakdown of incidence (new cases per year) and prevalence (total cases) per 100,000 population, with trends over roughly the past 10 years.

### United Kingdom (UK)
**Incidence:** The UK has documented a sharp rise in IIH incidence. An analysis of National Health Service data in England found that the annual incidence more than doubled between 2002 and 2016 – from about 2.3 per 100,000 to 4.7 per 100,000. Among women, the jump was even more pronounced: female incidence rose from 3.5 per 100,000 (2002) to 7.7 per 100,000 (2016). Men had much lower rates (about 0.9 rising to 1.6 per 100,000 in the same period). This equates to roughly a four- to five-fold higher incidence in women than men in recent years. The peak incidence in women occurs around age 25, reaching ~15 per 100,000 in that age group. 

**Prevalence:** The growing incidence has led to higher prevalence. In Wales (UK), the point prevalence of IIH climbed from 12 per 100,000 in 2003 to 76 per 100,000 by 2017. By 2017 Wales had 1,765 identified IIH patients (85% female) – an incidence of 7.8 per 100,000/year that year. These UK data underscore a dramatic increase, correlating with rising population body-mass index over the last decade.

### United States (US)
**Incidence:** Historically, IIH was considered rare in the general US population (around 0.9–1.0 new cases per 100,000 annually). Recent studies confirm that while overall incidence is still relatively low, it has been steadily rising. A nationwide analysis of hospital data (1997–2016) estimated a median annual incidence of about 1.15 per 100,000, with a significant upward trend over that period. For comparison, a population-based study in Minnesota found incidence 1.8 per 100,000 (1990–2014) and also increasing in later years. Notably, women have much higher rates: in the US dataset, females averaged ~1.97 per 100,000 vs. only 0.36 per 100,000 in males. This ~5:1 female-to-male incidence ratio is consistent with regional reports (e.g. historical data from Iowa showed 3.5 vs 0.3 in females vs males). The highest-risk group is young obese women – among women 20–44 who are >20% over ideal weight, incidence reaches ~19–20 per 100,000 (roughly 20 times the general population risk). A very recent U.S. electronic health record study (TriNetX network) suggests an even more dramatic rise in diagnoses: it reported incidence increasing from about 16 per 100,000 in the 1990s to 127 per 100,000 in the early 2020s (a ~7-fold relative jump). While that analysis uses a broad database and possibly different methodology, it reinforces that IIH cases have surged alongside obesity in the past decade. 

**Prevalence:** Prevalence data from a large U.S. study (85 million patient records) showed a significant increase in IIH prevalence between 2015 and 2022. In 2015 the prevalence was ~7.3 per 100,000, rising to ~9.9 per 100,000 by 2022. This is a 35% increase in seven years. Within these figures, notable disparities exist: Black female patients had the highest 2022 prevalence at 22.7 per 100,000, compared to 13.7 per 100,000 in White females. Hispanic females were intermediate, and Asian populations had much lower rates. Adolescents are a growing affected group as well – females aged 11–17 saw an increase of ~10 per 100,000 in prevalence by 2022. These data underscore that IIH is an increasing concern in the US, particularly among young, female, and obese demographics, and with pronounced racial/ethnic disparities.

### Australia
Australia, with high obesity rates, shows IIH incidence on par with other developed nations. Recent local data from Southern Tasmania (the Hobart region, 2016–2018) found an annual incidence of 5.4 per 100,000 adults. Strikingly, all identified new cases in that Tasmanian study were women aged 18–45. This incidence is comparable to the rates in female subpopulations of similar age reported elsewhere. It suggests that Australia's IIH burden – at least in urban/tertiary centers – is similar to the UK and US in the range of roughly 5–6 per 100,000 yearly (higher in high-BMI young women, lower in men). No large nationwide registry exists, but clinicians anecdotally report increasing IIH diagnoses in step with rising obesity in Australia, analogous to trends seen in the UK.

### Canada
Detailed epidemiological data for Canada are somewhat limited, but patterns are believed to mirror other high-income countries. Canada's obesity prevalence and healthcare access are similar to the UK, and thus IIH incidence is expected to be in the same ballpark (a few per 100,000 overall, higher among young obese women). One Canadian review noted that the highest incidence is among young obese women, at roughly 20 per 100,000 in that subgroup. The median age of onset in Canadian series is around 34 years, aligning with other studies. Pediatric IIH may be relatively more frequently recognized in Canada – for example, one report cites a pediatric incidence of ~4 per 100,000 in Canada vs. ~0.9 in the US, though this difference could reflect methodology or population structure. Overall, Canada is likely experiencing the same rise in IIH cases seen elsewhere in the past 10 years, given the parallel rise in obesity; however, published nationwide incidence or prevalence figures have not been widely reported in the last decade.

### Developed vs. Developing Regions
Epidemiology of IIH shows stark contrasts between high-obesity and low-obesity populations. Developed Western countries (North America, Europe, Australasia) now report incidence on the order of 1–7 per 100,000 in the general population (with higher pockets in young females as noted). In contrast, historically lower rates have been observed in parts of Asia and other regions. For example, in Japan (Hokkaido), the incidence in the early 1990s was as low as 0.03 per 100,000 – essentially negligible. Similarly, very low IIH prevalence has been linked to regions with traditionally low obesity rates in Asia. Meanwhile, the Middle East and North Africa have intermediate figures: in the 2000s, studies found incidence around 2.0–2.2 per 100,000 in Libya, Oman, and Israel, which is lower than recent UK/US levels but higher than East Asia. European studies from the 1990s also varied – for instance, 0.28 per 100,000 in a region of Italy vs. 3.2 per 100,000 in Spain – reflecting differences in obesity and possibly under-diagnosis. 

Notably, as developing countries urbanize and obesity rates climb, their IIH rates likely increase as well. The correlation between obesity prevalence and IIH incidence is strongly documented: globally, 57–100% of IIH patients are obese in published cohorts. Regions with rising obesity (including parts of the developing world) have started to see more IIH cases, eroding the historic gap. However, variations in healthcare access and diagnostics also influence reported rates. In summary, high-income nations currently shoulder a greater IIH burden, but the gap may narrow if lifestyle and obesity trends in developing regions continue.

### Sex and Age Breakdown
Across virtually all populations, female patients predominate in IIH statistics. Females typically account for 80–90% of cases in adults. The female-to-male incidence ratio ranges roughly from 3:1 up to 8:1 or higher, depending on the study. For example, recent UK data show about a 4–5:1 ratio (with women ~7.7 and men ~1.6 per 100k), while U.S. data showed ~5.5:1 on average. Some smaller series have found even more skewed ratios (e.g. Libyan data in the 1980s reported a 16:1 ratio) when virtually all cases were in overweight women. This sex difference emerges after puberty – pediatric IIH has a more equal sex balance, but by the late teens female incidence surges relative to males, suggesting a role for hormonal factors in addition to obesity. 

In terms of age, IIH most commonly presents in early to mid-adulthood. The median age of adult patients is around 28–30 years for women and early 30s for men. As noted, the highest incidence is observed in women of reproductive age (20s to 40s). Many studies cite the third decade of life as the peak time for IIH onset. Adolescent cases are increasingly recognized (with rising obesity in youth), and a smaller subset of cases occur in children and older adults, but these are less common. The disease in older patients (>45–50 years) is relatively rare compared to younger adults. The growing incidence among teenagers in recent data is a concerning trend, likely reflecting the shifting obesity demographics. 

In summary, over the last 10 years IIH has evolved from a rare neurologic curiosity to an increasingly encountered condition in neurology and ophthalmology clinics of the developed world. Incidence rates in the UK, US, Australia, and similar countries now reach up to ~5–8 per 100,000 (with prevalence on the order of 10–80 per 100,000), having climbed significantly since the early 2000s. Women – especially those who are younger and obese – are disproportionately affected, while men and populations in lower-obesity regions have far lower rates of IIH. These epidemiological shifts underscore the impact of the obesity epidemic and indicate that IIH is an emerging public health issue in need of ongoing monitoring and targeted interventions.
